# BinSearchTreeTraversals

In this file I have implemented the following items in Python:
1. a binary search tree class
2. inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal classes
3. a tester class

The binary search tree class creates a balanced binary search tree from a given list.

The three traversal classes traverse the binary tree in different ways.
The inorder traversal class traverses the left sub-tree, then visits the root, then traverses the right sub-tree, recursively.
The preorder traversal class visits the root, then traverses the left sub-tree, then the right sub-tree, recursively.
Lastly, the postorder traversal class traverses the left sub-tree, then the right sub-tree, then visits the root, recursively.

The tester class:
1. tests the binary search tree class using a random list
2. tests the binary tree traversal algorithms using the binary search tree object from (1)
